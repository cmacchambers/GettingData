#Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project 

##Introduction
This repository contains my submission for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The Codebook details all of the datafiles that are involved in the run_analysis.R Code.  

##Prerequisites for this script:

the UCI HAR Dataset must be extracted and
the UCI HAR Dataset must be availble in a directory called "UCI HAR Dataset"


The key datafiles are combined, filtered, re-labelled and summarized as indicated in the project requirements.

Finally, the script will create a tidy data set containing the means of all the columns per test subject and per activity. This tidy dataset will be written to a tab-delimited file called tidy.txt, which can also be found in this repository.
